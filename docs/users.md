Prince George County continues to have the second highest crime rate in the state of Maryland as evident by the Maryland Statistical Analysis Center (MSAC).
Every resident in PG county should have access to crime rate statistics as a way to empower them with the ability to make judgements in regards to areas they should stay away from.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of tools providing this kind of service.
For this reason, we have decided to create a front end web application where residents can input a zip code, address or city name.
The website would then present them with a report highlighting safety recommendations for that location.
